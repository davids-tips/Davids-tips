# About me!
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is David Powell. I use windows 10 manly and I like tynkering with aurduinos and automating stuff.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on starting my own website
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, css, discord.py, python, and javascript
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my website so create a branch and I will take a look at them.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my website and useful code and features for my discord bots.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about windows command line or discord bot coding notes.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dpowell6grade@gmail.com and dpowell2017@outlook.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: student and He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a high school student who is into discord.py.
- Notes:
  -    I am now starting to program my own bot for discord.py. It is called WhiskeyBot and is in Beta and Privite due to the danger of sharing repo's with discord bot tokens. (that and they delete tokens found on the internet) So for the time being it is privite. Though if you would like to share code snippits that may be useful pleae email them to my email on my profile. Thank you all for any assistance you man provide.
# Current Projects
